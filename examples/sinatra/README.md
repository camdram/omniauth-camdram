# Sinatra Example

This example clearly demonstrates how to use the omniauth-camdram strategy with a simple Sinatra web app.
You will need to create a new API app at https://www.camdram.net/api/apps before you continue.

## Setup

1. `git clone https://github.com/camdram/omniauth-camdram.git`
2. `cd omniauth-camdram/examples/sinatra`
3. Set the ENV variables CAMDRAM_APP_ID and CAMDRAM_APP_SECRET
4. Run the `rackup` command
5. Navigate to http://localhost:4567 and complete the login process
